# JS Starter

## getting started

I suggest having 2 console tabs open, one to fire up the server and listen for changes. The other to watch and build js files.

### installing dependencies

This will install all dependencies needed to compile the js and run the server

```sh
yarn # or npm install
```

### running local server

This will run a browser sync server at `http://localhost:3000`. All files in `public/dist` directory are being watched for changes and triggering a refresh.

```sh
yarn start # or npm start
```

### building JS files

This will bundle the js files

```sh
yarn build # or npm run build
```

### wathcing JS files

This will watch the js files and trigger a bundling of the js files

```sh
yarn watch # or npm run watch
```
